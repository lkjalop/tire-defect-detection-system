## üîç **TECHNICAL REALITY**

### **Core Implementation:**
```python
# Uses YOLOv8 nano model (6.2MB) - chosen for:
# - Fast inference (~40ms) suitable for real-time demo
# - Small size for edge deployment simulation
# - Good balance of speed/accuracy for proof of concept

from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Pre-trained on COCO dataset
results = model(frame)      # Standard object detection
```

### **Actual Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time object detection on video streams
- ‚úÖ Web-based interface for demonstration
- ‚úÖ Basic defect classification simulation
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring and logging
- ‚ùå NOT trained on actual tire defect data
- ‚ùå NOT validated against industrial standards
- ‚ùå NOT integrated with manufacturing systems

### **Architecture Decisions:**
- **Monolithic design** - Single file for simplicity and demonstration
- **Demo/simulation modes** - Ensures reliable demonstration
- **Standard frameworks** - FastAPI, OpenCV, YOLOv8 (proven technologies)
- **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks to maintain demo functionality
