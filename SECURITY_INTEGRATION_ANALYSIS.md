# üîí SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY & HIRING IMPACT ANALYSIS

## **SECURITY ASPECTS IMPLEMENTED**

### **Concise Security Addition for Resume:**

```
Rubicon Tire Defect Detection System | Go Cloud Architects | 2024
Edge AI IoT Physical Architecture Design | Repository: https://github.com/lkjalop/tire-defect-detection-system

‚Ä¢ Developed YOLOv8-based computer vision pipeline to detect surface defects in tire manufacturing environments
‚Ä¢ Built enterprise-aligned FastAPI backend with async processing, Docker deployment, and OpenAPI documentation
‚Ä¢ Implemented enterprise security framework: authentication layers, input validation, rate limiting, and audit logging for compliance
‚Ä¢ Designed for edge environments to minimize latency and reduce dependency on cloud infrastructure
‚Ä¢ Navigated complex environment constraints to deliver working fallback demo and reliable inference module
‚Ä¢ Project framed as a scalable foundation for modernizing quality control pipelines in high-throughput manufacturing sectors
```

**Alternative Security Integration (if space is tight):**
```
‚Ä¢ Built enterprise-aligned FastAPI backend with async processing, security hardening, Docker deployment, and OpenAPI documentation
```

### **Security Features Actually Implemented:**

‚úÖ **Authentication & Authorization**
