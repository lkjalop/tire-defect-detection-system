### **Repository Access:**
- **GitHub**: `https://github.com/lkjalop/tire-defect-detection-system`
- **Main System**: `honest_edge_ai.py` 
- **Security Framework**: `security/threat_mitigations.py`
- **Validation Suite**: `expert_review_test.py` + `quick_validation.py`

---

## 🚀 **STEP-BY-STEP TESTING PROTOCOL**

### **Phase 1: Initial Assessment (2 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Quick system validation
python quick_validation.py

# 2. Check deployment readiness  
python test_deployment.py

# Expected: All tests pass, zero critical issues
```

### **Phase 2: Architecture Review (5 minutes)**
```bash
# 3. Run comprehensive expert validation
python expert_review_test.py

# 4. Test main system functionality
python honest_edge_ai.py --mode demo

# Expected: Educational scenarios run, clear honest labeling
```

### **Phase 3: Technical Deep Dive (10 minutes)**
```bash
# 5. Test API functionality
python honest_edge_ai.py --mode api --port 8000
# Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs (FastAPI documentation)
# Test endpoints: /capabilities, /demo, /analyze

# 6. Security framework inspection
python -c "from security.threat_mitigations import *; print('Security framework loaded')"
```

### **Phase 4: Code Quality Assessment (15 minutes)**
```bash
# 7. Examine key files in order:
# - honest_edge_ai.py (main system)
# - security/threat_mitigations.py (security framework)  
# - README.md (documentation)
# - DEPLOYMENT.md (deployment guide)
```
