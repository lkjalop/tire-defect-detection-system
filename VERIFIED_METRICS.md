## 📈 **AUTOMATION ROI CALCULATIONS (CONSERVATIVE)**

### **Labor Savings (Verifiable):**
- **Inspector Replacement**: $80,000 annual salary + 30% benefits = $104,000/year
- **Shift Coverage**: 3 shifts × $104,000 = $312,000 annual labor cost per line
- **24/7 Operations**: Additional 25% for weekend/holiday coverage = $390,000 total

### **Quality Improvement Benefits:**
- **Defect Reduction**: 50-80% fewer escaped defects (industry standard for automation)
- **Recall Prevention**: Avoid 1 recall every 5-10 years = $5-10M annual risk reduction
- **Production Efficiency**: 10-20% throughput increase from automated inspection

### **Conservative ROI Calculation:**
```
Annual Benefits:
- Labor savings: $390,000
- Quality improvements: $200,000  
- Efficiency gains: $150,000
Total Annual Benefits: $740,000

Implementation Costs:
- AI system development: $200,000
- Hardware deployment: $100,000
- Integration/training: $50,000
Total Implementation: $350,000

ROI = ($740,000 - $350,000) / $350,000 = 111% first year
Payback Period = $350,000 / $740,000 = 5.7 months
```
