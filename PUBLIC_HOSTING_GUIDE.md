## üåê Alternative Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Static Version)
**Convert your demo to static HTML:**

```bash
# Create static version
python -c "
import requests
html = requests.get('http://localhost:8002').text
with open('index.html', 'w') as f:
    f.write(html.replace('http://localhost:8002', ''))
"
```

Then deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Create `docs/` folder in your repo
2. Move `index.html` to `docs/`
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
4. **Live URL:** `https://lkjalop.github.io/tire-defect-detection-system`

### Option 2: Vercel (Modern Platform)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Custom domain supported
vercel domains add yourdomain.com
```

### Option 3: Render (Python-Focused)
1. Connect GitHub repo to Render.com
2. Choose "Web Service"
3. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set start command: `python enhanced_demo.py`
5. **Live URL:** `https://your-app.onrender.com`

### Option 4: Azure Static Web Apps (Enterprise)
```bash
# Using Azure CLI
az staticwebapp create \
  --name tire-defect-demo \
  --source https://github.com/lkjalop/tire-defect-detection-system \
  --location "Central US" \
  --branch main
```

### Option 5: DigitalOcean App Platform
1. Create account at digitalocean.com
2. Create new App
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Configure Python app settings
5. **Cost:** $5/month for basic droplet

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security & Professional Considerations

### Data Protection
```python
# Add environment variable for demo mode
import os

DEMO_MODE = os.getenv('DEMO_MODE', 'true').lower() == 'true'

if DEMO_MODE:
    # Show simulated data with disclaimers
    display_data = get_demo_data()
else:
    # Connect to real systems (production only)
    display_data = get_production_data()
```

### Rate Limiting
```python
# Add to enhanced_demo.py
rate_limits = {}
def check_rate_limit(ip):
    import time
    now = time.time()
    if ip not in rate_limits:
        rate_limits[ip] = []
    rate_limits[ip] = [t for t in rate_limits[ip] if now - t < 60]
    
    if len(rate_limits[ip]) > 10:  # 10 requests per minute
        return False
    rate_limits[ip].append(now)
    return True
```

### Custom Domain Setup
```bash
# For professional URL like demo.yourname.com
1. Buy domain from Namecheap/GoDaddy ($10/year)
2. Add CNAME record pointing to hosting platform
3. Configure SSL certificate (usually automatic)

Example:
demo.kevinai.com ‚Üí points to Railway/Vercel deployment
```
