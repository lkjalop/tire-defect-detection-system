🏗️ ENTERPRISE AI ARCHITECTURE DEMO v2.0
🎓 PRODUCTION-READY YOLOV8 INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK

⚠️  SCOPE & DISCLAIMERS:
    • Real YOLOv8 model integration with production architecture
    • Uses pre-trained models for object detection demonstration  
    • Enterprise FastAPI patterns and security implementation
    • Educational/demo dataset - not production tire-specific training
    
    FOR ML ENGINEERS: This framework is ready for your custom models!
    Replace the general object detection with tire-specific training data.

DEMO: python tire_detection_system.py --mode demo
API:  python tire_detection_system.py --mode api

✅ REAL TECHNICAL COMPONENTS:
   • YOLOv8 model loading and inference (when available)
   • OpenCV image preprocessing pipeline
   • FastAPI async enterprise patterns
   • Docker-ready production architecture
   • OWASP security implementation
   • Real-time ML inference processing

🎯 Perfect for demonstrating ML deployment and software architecture skills
