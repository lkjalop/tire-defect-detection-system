## ❌ **Critical Issues Identified**

### **1. NumPy 2.x Compatibility Crisis**
```
❌ MAJOR: NumPy 2.3.1 installed (incompatible with most CV libraries)
❌ Ultralytics/YOLOv8: Cannot import due to NumPy 2.x incompatibility
❌ OpenCV: Cannot import due to _ARRAY_API not found error
❌ System Impact: Core computer vision functionality broken
```

### **2. Dependency Chain Failures**
```
❌ CV2 Bootstrap Error: AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found
❌ Ultralytics Import Error: Multiple module import failures
❌ Security Module Missing: threat_mitigations import fails
❌ Environment Path Issues: Module discovery problems
```

### **3. Production Readiness Gaps**
```
❌ No Real Model Loading: YOLO model not actually loading
❌ Simulation Mode Only: All detection results are simulated
❌ Security Components Disabled: SECURITY_ENABLED = False
❌ No Integration Testing: Components work in isolation only
```

### **4. Technical Debt Issues**
```
❌ Pydantic Namespace Warning: model_status field conflicts
❌ Character Encoding Issues: Required main_fixed.py workaround
❌ Import Path Complexity: Manual sys.path.append required
❌ Graceful Degradation: Falls back to simulation but loses core value
```
